# CARLA Typing Stubs

Some IDE might not support CARLA typing out of box. We use this library [carla-python-stubs](https://github.com/aasewold/carla-python-stubs)
to generate stubs and store it for version 0.9.15 at [3rd_party/typings/carla](https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead/tree/main/3rd_party/typings/carla).
