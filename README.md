## Overview

We release the complete pipeline required to achieve state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark. Built around the CARLA simulator, the stack features a data-centric design with:

- Extensive visualization suite, runtime type validation and evaluation infraction tracker.
- Optimized storage format, packs 72 hours of driving in ~260GB.
- Native support for NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-based E2E.

## Roadmap

- [x] ✅ Checkpoints and inference code (stable)
- [x] 🟨 Documentation, training pipeline and expert code (released, under test)
- [x] 🟨 Full CARLA dataset release on HuggingFace (released, under test)
- [ ] 🚧 Datasets for cross-benchmark (coming soon)
- [ ] 🚧 Cross-benchmark training tools and documentation (coming soon)

Status: Active development.

## Updates

- **`[2026/01/13]`** CARLA dataset and full CARLA training doc release
  > We publicly release a CARLA dataset generated with the same pipeline as used in the paper. However, due to subsequent refactoring and cleanup of the expert driver, the released dataset is not bit-identical to the dataset used for the reported experiments. A verification of the dataset is running right now.

- **`[2026/01/05]`** Bug in RoutePlanner fixed
  > An index error caused driving policy to to crash at end of routes in Town13. New Driving Score are updated.

- **`[2025/12/24]`** Arxiv paper and code release

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment initialization

Clone the repository and map the project root to your environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.git
cd lead
```

Set up environment variables

```bash
echo -e "export LEAD_PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc  # Set project root variable
echo "source $(pwd)/scripts/main.sh" >> ~/.bashrc       # Persist more environment variables
source ~/.bashrc                                        # Reload config
```

Please verify that ~/.bashrc reflects these paths correctly.

### 2. Setup experiment infrastructure

We utilize [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install), conda-lock and uv:

```bash
# Install conda-lock and create conda environment
pip install conda-lock && conda-lock install -n lead conda-lock.yml
# Activate conda environment
conda activate lead
# Install dependencies and setup git hooks
pip install uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && uv pip install -e .
# Install other tools needed for development
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg conda-forge::parallel conda-forge::tree conda-forge::gcc
# Optional: Activate git hooks
pre-commit install
```

While waiting for dependencies installation, we recommend CARLA setup on parallel:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_carla.sh # Download and setup CARLA at 3rd_party/CARLA_0915
```

### 3. Model zoo

Pre-trained driving policies are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ln2697/tfv6) for reproducibility. These checkpoints follow the TFv6 architecture, but differ in their sensor configurations, vision backbones or dataset composition.

**Table 1:** Performance of pre-trained checkpoints. We report Driving Score, for which higher is better.

</div>
<br>

To download one checkpoint:

```bash
bash scripts/download_one_checkpoint.sh
```

Or download all checkpoints at once with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage">git lfs</a>

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/ln2697/tfv6 outputs/checkpoints
cd outputs/checkpoints
git lfs pull
```

### 4. Verify driving stack

To initiate closed-loop evaluation and verify the integration of the driving stack, execute the following:

```bash
# Start driving environment
bash scripts/start_carla.sh
# Start policy on one route
bash scripts/eval_bench2drive.sh
```

Driving logs will be saved to <code>outputs/local_evaluation</code> with the following structure:

```html
outputs/local_evaluation/1_town15_construction
├── 1_town15_construction_debug.mp4
├── 1_town15_construction_demo.mp4
├── 1_town15_construction_input.mp4
├── checkpoint_endpoint.json
├── debug_images
├── demo_images
├── input_images
├── input_log
├── infractions.json
├── metric_info.json
└── qualitative_results.mp4
```
Launch the interactive infraction dashboard to analyze driving failures:

```bash
python lead/infraction_webapp/app.py
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the dashboard

<br>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Disable video recording in [config_closed_loop](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py) by turning off `produce_demo_video` and `produce_debug_video`.
> 2. If memory is limited, modify the file prefixes to load only the first checkpoint seed. By default, the pipeline loads all three seeds as an ensemble.

### 5. Verify autopilot

Verify the expert policy and data acquisition pipeline by executing a test run on a sample route:

```bash
# Start CARLA if not done already
bash scripts/start_carla.sh
# Run expert on one route
bash scripts/run_expert.sh
```

Data collected will be stored at <code>data/expert_debug</code> and should have following structure:

```html
data/expert_debug/
├── data
│   └── debug_routes
│       └── Town15_Rep-1_1_town15_construction_route0_01_15_12_48_52
│           ├── bboxes
│           ├── camera_pc

│           ├── semantics
│           └── semantics_perturbated
└── results
    └── 1_town15_construction_result.json
```

The [Jupyter notebooks](notebooks) provide some quick scripts to visualize the collected data:

## Beyond CARLA: Cross-Benchmark Deployment

The LEAD pipeline and TFv6 models are deployed as **reference implementations and benchmark entries** across multiple autonomous driving simulators and evaluation suites:

* **[Waymo Vision-based End-to-End Driving Challenge (DiffusionLTF)](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2025/e2e-driving/)**
  Strong baseline entry for the inaugural end-to-end driving challenge hosted by Waymo, achieving **2nd place** in the final leaderboard.

* **[NAVSIM v1 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2024-P/e2e-driving-navtest)**
  Latent TransFuser v6 is an updated reference baseline for the `navtest` split, improving PDMS by +3 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, used to evaluate navigation and control under diverse driving conditions.

* **[NAVSIM v2 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2025/e2e-driving-navhard)**
  The same Latent TransFuser v6 improves EPMDS by +6 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, targeting distribution shift and scenario complexity.

* **[NVIDIA AlpaSim Simulator (TransFuserModel)](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpasim)**
  Adapting the NAVSIM's Latent TransFuser v6 checkpoints, AlpaSim also features an official TransFuser driver, serving as a baseline policy for closed-loop simulation.
