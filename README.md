**Driving stress test:** Closed-loop execution of TransFuser v6, the latest iteration of the TransFuser family, demonstrating stable control in a complex urban scenario under degraded perception and adversarial traffic.

</div>

## Overview

We release the complete pipeline (covering scenario descriptions, expert driver, data preprocessing scripts, training code, and evaluation infrastructure) required to achieve state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark. Built around the CARLA simulator, the stack features a data-centric design with:

- Extensive visualization suite and runtime type validation for easier debugging.
- Optimized storage format, packs 72 hours of driving in ~200GB.
- Native support for NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-based E2E, with LEAD extending these benchmarks through closed-loop simulation and synthetic data for additional supervision during training.

## Quick Start (Get Driving in 20 Minutes)

**1. Environment initialization**

Clone the repository and map the project root to your environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.git
cd lead

# Set the project root directory and configure paths for CARLA, datasets, and dependencies.
{
  echo -e "export LEAD_PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)"  # Set project root variable
  echo "source $(pwd)/scripts/main.sh"       # Persist more environment variables
} >> ~/.bashrc  # Append to bash config to persist across sessions

source ~/.bashrc  # Reload config to apply changes immediately
```

> [!NOTE]
> Please verify that ~/.bashrc reflects these paths correctly.

**2. Setup experiment infrastructure**

We utilize [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) and conda-lock for a more deterministic build:

```bash
# Install conda-lock and create conda environment
pip install conda-lock && conda-lock install -n lead conda-lock.yml
# Activate conda environment
conda activate lead
# Install dependencies and setup git hooks
pip install uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && uv pip install -e .
# Install other tools needed for development
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg conda-forge::parallel conda-forge::tree conda-forge::gcc
# Optional: Activate git hooks
pre-commit install
```

While waiting for dependencies installation, we recommend CARLA setup on parallel:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_carla.sh # Download and setup CARLA at 3rd_party/CARLA_0915
```

**3. Model zoo**

Pre-trained driving policies are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ln2697/TFv6) for reproducibility. These checkpoints follow the TFv6 architecture
(detailed in Fig. 1), but differ in their sensor configurations, vision backbones or dataset composition.

Tab. 1 shows available checkpoints with their performance on three major CARLA benchmarks. As first step, we recommend `tfv6_resnet34` as it provides a good balance between performance and resource usage.

**Table 1:** Performance of pre-trained checkpoints. We report Driving Score, for which higher is better.

To download one checkpoint:

```bash
bash scripts/download_one_checkpoint.sh
```

Or download all checkpoints at once with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage">git lfs</a>

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/ln2697/TFv6 outputs/checkpoints
cd outputs/checkpoints
git lfs pull
```

**4. Verify driving stack**

To initiate closed-loop evaluation and verify the integration of the driving stack, execute the following:

```bash
# Start driving environment
bash scripts/start_carla.sh
# Start policy on one route
bash scripts/eval_bench2drive.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Driving logs will be saved to <code>outputs/local_evaluation</code> with the following structure:</summary>

```html
outputs/local_evaluation
├── 23687
│   ├── checkpoint_endpoint.json
│   ├── debug_images
│   ├── demo_images
│   └── metric_info.json
├── 23687_debug.mp4
└── 23687_demo.mp4
```
</details>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Disable video recording in [config_closed_loop](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py) by turning off `produce_demo_video` and `produce_debug_video`.
> 2. If memory is limited, modify the file prefixes to load only the first checkpoint seed. By default, the pipeline loads all three seeds as an ensemble.

**5. Verify autopilot**

Verify the expert policy and data acquisition pipeline by executing a test run on a sample route:

```bash
# Start CARLA if not done already
bash scripts/start_carla.sh
# Run expert on one route
bash scripts/run_expert.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Data collected will be stored at <code>data/expert_debug</code> and should have following structure:</summary>

```html
data/expert_debug
├── data
│   └── BlockedIntersection
│       └── 999_Rep-1_Town06_13_route0_12_22_22_34_45

## Beyond CARLA: Cross-Benchmark Deployment

The LEAD pipeline and TFv6 models are deployed as **reference implementations and benchmark entries** across multiple autonomous driving simulators and evaluation suites:

* **[Waymo Vision-based End-to-End Driving Challenge (DiffusionLTF)](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2025/e2e-driving/)**
  Strong baseline entry for the inaugural end-to-end driving challenge hosted by Waymo, achieving **2nd place** in the final leaderboard.

* **[NAVSIM v1 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2024-P/e2e-driving-navtest)**
  Latent TransFuser v6 is an updated reference baseline for the `navtest` split, improving PDMS by +3 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, used to evaluate navigation and control under diverse driving conditions.

* **[NAVSIM v2 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2025/e2e-driving-navhard)**
  The same Latent TransFuser v6 improves EPMDS by +6 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, targeting distribution shift and scenario complexity.

* **[NVIDIA AlpaSim Simulator (TransFuserModel)](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpasim)**
  Adapting the NAVSIM's Latent TransFuser v6 checkpoints, AlpaSim also features an official TransFuser driver, serving as a baseline policy for closed-loop simulation.

These deployments demonstrate the flexibility of LEAD as a portable training and inference stack that can be adapted across environments, sensor configurations, and evaluation protocols.

LEAD complements existing benchmarks by extending them with reproducible long-horizon closed-loop evaluation and additional synthetic supervision benefits of CARLA.
